# 2d Unity Basics

 2D Unity game based on brackeys tutorials, focusing on movement using unity rigid body physics.
 
 Sunnyland assets used for sprites/tiles + map generation.
 
 Minor animations also added from same package.
 
 Expanded the movement and animations controller to allow for wall grabs.

 Added A* pathfinding for AI bird unity. Also added combat between player and bird - player can jump on birds to kill them, otherwise birds will attack player on any other collisions.
